<p>Deagon Slipways is a family operated yard owned by the sailer and boatbuilder, Peter Kerr. Located on Cabbage Tree Creek in the Sandgate reigon the yard has been operating for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>At the yard we specialise in the maintenance and restoration of wooden boats, with a crew of experienced boatbuilders who have worked on a range of projects. We also cater for boats of various construction types other than timber. In addition we can carry out other marine projects on request.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2015, the slipway will be creating a line of composite sailing dinghies.</p>
<p>Whether you need a full restoration, some maintenance or just some advice, give us a call.</p>
