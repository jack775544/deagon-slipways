<p>Based off the model of the original sailing tender for the classic yacht Laurabada, the Deagon Dinghy is a composite construction rowing/sailing gaff rigged dinghy suited for boats of all sizes. These are perfect as a yacht tender or as a pleasure sailer.</p>
<p>Constructed using carbon fiber, these tenders are lightweight (16kg) but strong enough to endure the elements.</p>
<p>The gaff rig, is perfect for a large variety of weather conditions and the unstayed rig allows easy assembly and storage.</p>
<p>The dinghies are created on the classic lines of the original tender and still have the charm of the original.</p>
